# ⚡ PeekXtract 
### Smart Remote ZIP Peeks & Selective Downloads

---

## 🌟 Overview

### **PeekXtract** is a powerful tool I built to help you easily read and download files from large ZIP archives hosted online over HTTP.
**What sets PeekXtract apart? Instead of downloading the entire archive, it lets you **peek inside ZIP files** and selectively extract just the files you actually need—saving you both bandwidth and time. 😎**
